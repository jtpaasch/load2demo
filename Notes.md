# Notes

I typed up my notes as I worked through this here.


## The programs

There are three programs in `resources`. 

The first one, `main_1.asm`, has a `main` function that looks like this:

```
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          
        SECTION .text
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          

main:
        mov     rax, 0x5 ; Return 5                                            
        ret
.end:
```

It puts the literal/immediate value `0x5` directly in `rax`, and returns.

The second one, `main_2.asm`, has a `main` function that looks like this:

```
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          
        SECTION .text
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          

main:
        mov     rax, 0x3 ; Return 3                                            
        ret
.end:
```

It puts the literal/immediate value `0x3` directly in `rax`, and returns.

The third one, `main_3.asm`, has a `main` function that looks like this:

```
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          
        SECTION .data
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          

loc_1   DB 0x3  ; Store 3 at an address called "loc_1"                         


;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          
        SECTION .text
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------          

main:
        mov rax, [loc_1] ; Return 3                                            
        ret
.end:
```

This one puts the value `0x3` in a location in memory (named `loc_1`), and
then it puts the contents of that address into `rax` and returns.

You can build all three from the root of the repo:

    make -C resources

Run each one, to confirm that they produce the expected exit codes:

    > ./resources/main_1
    > echo $? # returns 5

    > ./resources/main_2
    > echo $? # returns 3

    > ./resources/main_3
    > echo $? # returns 3

Semantically, `main_1` and `main_2` are similar, except they put a different
literal/immediate value into `rax` before returning. 

By contrast, `main_2` and `main_3` are similar, except `main_2` puts the value 
`0x3` directly into `rax`, while `main_3` gets that same value from memory.


## Loading again merges?

In the plugin (`load2demo.ml`), there is a loader function that loads a
binary executable:

```
let load (filename : string) : Project.t =
  let input = Project.Input.file ~loader ~filename in
  let proj = Project.create input ~package:filename in
  match proj with
  | Ok p -> p
  | Error e -> failwith @@ Error.to_string_hum e
```

Suppose you use this function to load two binary executables `exe_1` and
`exe_`2, one after the other, before you extract the programs from them. 
Like this:

```
let proj_1 = load exe_1 in
let proj_2 = load exe_2 in

let prog_1 = Project.program proj_1 in
let prog_2 = Project.program proj_2 in
...
```

When you run `load` twice like this, it looks like BAP merges the second 
program with the first. It's as if BAP overwrites the first one with 
information it gets from the second one.

Let me demonstrate what I see. First, look at how BAP sees the 
`main` function of the first program, `main_1`:

    bap resources/main_1 -d --print-symbol=main

What I see is this:

```
000007b8: program
000007a6: sub main(main_argc, main_argv, main_result)
000007c8: main_argc :: in u32 = RDI
000007c9: main_argv :: in out u64 = RSI
000007ca: main_result :: out u32 = RAX

000003fc:
00000401: RAX := 5
0000040a: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
0000040d: RSP := RSP + 8
00000411: call #45 with noreturn
```

Notice the statement at TID `401`: 

    RAX := 5

Now look at `main_2`:

    bap resources/main_2 -d --print-symbol=main

What I see is this:

```
000007ac: program
000007a6: sub main(main_argc, main_argv, main_result)
000007bc: main_argc :: in u32 = RDI
000007bd: main_argv :: in out u64 = RSI
000007be: main_result :: out u32 = RAX

000003fc:
00000401: RAX := 3
0000040a: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
0000040d: RSP := RSP + 8
00000411: call #45 with noreturn
```

Notice the statement at TID `401`:

    RAX := 3

Now run the `load2demo` plugin, and let it load `main_1` and `main_2`,
and merge them:

    bap load2demo resources/main_1 resources/main_2 --merge

When it's done, the plugin prints the BIR of the two `main` functions that it
has loaded:

```
=== MAIN (First EXE) ============================
00000f2b: sub main()


00000b81:
00000b86: RAX := 3
00000b8f: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
00000b92: RSP := RSP + 8
00000b96: call #45 with noreturn

=== MAIN (Second EXE) ===========================
00000f2b: sub main()


00000b81:
00000b86: RAX := 3
00000b8f: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
00000b92: RSP := RSP + 8
00000b96: call #45 with noreturn
```

Notice that the TIDs for the two functions are the same. Notice also that in 
both programs, the relevant statement is the same. At TID `b86`, it is this:

    RAX := 3

That's not what I expected. I expected the first program to have `RAX := 5`,
while the second `RAX := 3`.

So, it would appear from this that BAP has loaded the second program right
over the top of the first program (or rather, has merged the second one
over the first one, and in this case, taken `RAX := 3` as the most 
authoritative version of that statement, since it was loaded second).


## Loading without merging

In the previous example, I caused BAP to merge the two programs by loading 
the two executables back to back, like this:

```
let proj_1 = load exe_1 in
let proj_2 = load exe_2 in

let prog_1 = Project.program proj_1 in
let prog_2 = Project.program proj_2 in
...
``` 

Notice that I didn't _extract_ the programs from the projects until after
I loaded the two projects first.

Let's do it differently. Let's load the first project and extract its program
_before_ loading the second project and extracting its program. Like this:

```
let proj_1 = load exe_1 in
let prog_1 = Project.program proj_1 in

let proj_2 = load exe_2 in
let prog_2 = Project.program proj_2 in
...
``` 

When doing things this way, BAP doesn't appear to merge the programs.

To confirm, run the `load2demo` plugin on `main_1` and `main_2` without using
the `--merge` flag:

    bap load2demo resources/main_1 resources/main_2 

When it's finished, the plugin prints the two `main` functions it's loaded:

```
=== MAIN (First EXE) ============================
000007a6: sub main()


000003fc:
00000401: RAX := 5
0000040a: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
0000040d: RSP := RSP + 8
00000411: call #45 with noreturn

=== MAIN (Second EXE) ===========================
00000f4b: sub main()


00000ba1:
00000ba6: RAX := 3
00000baf: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
00000bb2: RSP := RSP + 8
00000bb6: call #45 with noreturn
```

This time, the two programs are as I expected. The first one has
`RAX := 5`, and the second one has `RAX := 3`, just as in the assembly. 

Also, notice that the TIDs are different. The second program has its own
set of TIDs, whereas before, the two `main` functions had the same TIDs.

It would appear from this that, if you extract the program using
`Project.program foo` before calling `load` again, the programs stay distinct.

It also appears from this that the TIDs are generated at the time that
BAP extracts the program, rather than at the time it loads the project?
That is, the TIDs seem to be generated when you call `Project.program`,
rather than when you call `Project.create`?


## Conflicts

When merging `main_1` and `main_2` before, recall that BAP did not see
any conflict in the values `5` and `3`, and it merged the second program
into the first one, letting `3` overwrite `5` without any complaint.

Perhaps BAP thinks the semantics of `RAX := 5` and `RAX := 3` are equivalent, 
or at least it does not see a conflict? Perhaps what BAP really sees is 
something like this: `RAX := Some constant`?

Let me try the same thing with `main_2` and `main_3`. These two programs
return the same value (`RAX` ends up with `3` stashed in it), but they get 
that value in different ways: `main_2` puts that value in `RAX` directly, and
`main_3` pulls it from a location in memory.

Check how BAP sees the `main` function from `main_2` again:

    bap resources/main_2 -d --print-symbol=main

Which prints:

```
000007b8: program
000007a6: sub main(main_argc, main_argv, main_result)
000007c8: main_argc :: in u32 = RDI
000007c9: main_argv :: in out u64 = RSI
000007ca: main_result :: out u32 = RAX

000003fc:
00000401: RAX := 3
0000040a: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
0000040d: RSP := RSP + 8
00000411: call #45 with noreturn
```

And now look at how BAP sees the `main` function of `main_3`:

    bap resources/main_3 -d --print-symbol=main

Which prints:

```
000007ac: program
000007a6: sub main(main_argc, main_argv, main_result)
000007bc: main_argc :: in u32 = RDI
000007bd: main_argv :: in out u64 = RSI
000007be: main_result :: out u32 = RAX

000003fc:
00000401: RAX := mem[0x601030, el]:u64
0000040a: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
0000040d: RSP := RSP + 8
00000411: call #45 with noreturn
```

Notice the statement at TID `401`: it loads the value from memory location
(`0x601030`) into `RAX`. If I look at the data section of the executable:

    objdump -Ds resources/main_3

I can see that address `0x601030` has the value `3` in it:

```
0000000000601030 <loc_1>:
  601030:	03                   	.byte 0x3
```

Now load the programs, and let BAP try to merge them:

    bap load2demo resources/main_2 resources/main_3 --merge

This time, BAP complains that it can't join (merge) the information it gets
from the second program with the information it has about the first:

```
Uncaught exception:
  
  Unable to update the slot bap:mem of 0x4004e0,
Domain mem doesn't have a join for values (4004e0 8 LittleEndian) and 
(4004e0 5 LittleEndian)`
```

I'm not sure I totally understand the error here, but it is saying it cannot
merge the instructions from the two versions of the program at address
`0x4004e0`. If I look at the programs, for example `main_3`:

    objdump -Ds resources/main_3

I see that address `0x4004e0` contains the instruction to insert
the value from memory into `RAX`:

```
00000000004004e0 <main>:
  4004e0:	48 8b 04 25 30 10 60 	mov    0x601030,%rax
```

But if I look at the `main_2`:

    objdump -Ds resources/main_2

I see at the same address the instruction to insert the immediate value 3
into `RAX`:

```
00000000004004e0 <main>:
  4004e0:	b8 03 00 00 00       	mov    $0x3,%eax
```

And BAP sees these two versions of the instruction as conflicting. That makes
sense, I think. The semantics of assigning a literal value to a register is
presumably seen by BAP as different from the semantics of taking a value from
a location in memory and putting it there.


## No conflicts

Now try loading `main_2` and `main_3` without merging (i.e., without using
the `--merge` flag):

    bap load2demo resources/main_2 resources/main_3 

When it's finished, the plugin prints the two `main` functions it's loaded:

```
=== MAIN (First EXE) ============================
000007a6: sub main()


000003fc:
00000401: RAX := 3
0000040a: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
0000040d: RSP := RSP + 8
00000411: call #45 with noreturn

=== MAIN (Second EXE) ===========================
00000f4b: sub main()


00000ba1:
00000ba6: RAX := mem[0x601030, el]:u64
00000baf: #45 := mem[RSP, el]:u64
00000bb2: RSP := RSP + 8
00000bb6: call #45 with noreturn
```

Here I see that the two programs are different, with distinct TIDs.
